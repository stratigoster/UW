me: 63k
pack: 61k
compress: 43k
gzip: 25k

My algorithm is clearly worse than pack/compress/gzip. If I had an extra 2
weeks, I would try to implement adaptive Huffman (where nodes are added to
the tree on the fly), or look into LZW. 

The reason that the algorithm in the assignment is worse is possibly due to
the codelengths of the intial 1000 characters, which aren't really
optimized.
