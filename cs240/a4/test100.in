      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

gateway
A device connected to multiple physical TCP/IP networks capable of routing or delivering IP packets between them. A gateway translates between different transport protocols or data formats (for example, IPX and IP) and is generally added to a network primarily for its translation ability. 

In the context of interoperating with Novell NetWare networks, a gateway acts as a bridge between the server message block (SMB) protocol used by Windows networks and the NetWare core protocol (NCP) used by NetWare networks. A gateway is also called an IP router.


GDI objects
Objects from the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) library of application programming interfaces (APIs) for graphics output devices. In Task Manager, the number of GDI objects currently used by a process.

See also: Task Manager
Generic Service resource
A Windows service that is supported as a cluster resource by a Resource DLL.

See also: Resource DLL
gigabyte (GB)
1,024 megabytes, though often interpreted as approximately one billion bytes.

global account
In an Active Directory network, a normal user account in a user's domain. Most user accounts are global accounts. If there are multiple domains in the network, it is best if each user in the network has only one user account in only one domain, and each user's access to other domains is accomplished through the establishment of domain trust relationships.

See also: Active Directory; domain
global catalog
A domain controller that contains a partial replica of every domain in Active Directory. In other words, a global catalog holds a replica of every object in Active Directory, but with a limited number of each object's attributes. The global catalog stores those attributes most frequently used in search operations (such as a user's first and last names) and those attributes required to locate a full replica of the object. 

The Active Directory replication system builds the global catalog automatically. The attributes replicated into the global catalog include a base set defined by Microsoft. Administrators can specify additional properties to meet the needs of their installation.


See also: Active Directory; attribute; domain controller; replication
global group
A security or distribution group that can have users, groups, and computers from its own domain as members. Global security groups can be granted rights and permissions on resources in any domain in the forest. Global groups cannot be created or maintained on computers running Windows XP Professional. However, for Windows XP Professional computers that participate in a domain, domain global groups can be granted rights and permissions at those workstations and can become members of local groups at those workstations.

See also: permission; group; local group; user account
glue chasing
The follow-up queries or successive lookups that are made to resolve glue records in a zone to other remote DNS servers that are authoritative for a derivative zone. When glue chasing is performed, name server (NS) resource records for delegated DNS servers are chased, or followed, by using successive queries to resolve the servers named in NS records to their host address (A) resource records and to obtain server IP addresses.

See also: A (address) resource record; delegation; DNS Server; glue record; name server (NS) resource record; zone
glue record
A resource record for out-of-zone information used to provide helpful pointer information for locating DNS servers that have been delegated authority for specific subdomains derived from a zone's domain of origin. These records are used to glue zones together and provide an effective delegation and referral path for other DNS servers to follow when performing a recursive lookup to fully resolve a name.

See also: delegation; DNS Server; domain of origin; glue chasing; resource record (RR); zone
graphics mode
A display mode in which lines and characters on the screen are drawn pixel by pixel. Graphics mode displays images by grouping individual dots into shapes, such as the arrowhead of a mouse pointer. It can also preview character formatting, such as boldface and italics, as it will appear in print.

group
A collection of users, computers, contacts, and other groups. Groups can be used as security or as e-mail distribution collections. Distribution groups are used only for e-mail. Security groups are used both to grant access to resources and as e-mail distribution lists.

See also: domain; global group; local group
group account
A collection of user accounts. By making a user account a member of a group, you give the related user all the rights and permissions granted to the group.

See also: group; user account
group memberships
The groups to which a user account belongs. Permissions and rights granted to a group are also provided to its members. In most cases, the actions a user can perform in Windows are determined by the group memberships of the user account to which the user is logged on.

See also: group; user account
group name
A unique name identifying a local group or a global group to Windows. A group's name cannot be identical to any other group name or user name in its own domain or computer.

See also: global group; local group
Group Policy
The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in that is used to edit Group Policy objects.

See also: Group Policy object; Microsoft Management Console (MMC); policy; snap-in
Group Policy object
A collection of Group Policy settings. Group Policy objects are essentially the documents created by the Group Policy snap-in, a Windows utility. Group Policy objects are stored at the domain level, and they affect users and computers contained in sites, domains, and organizational units. In addition, each Windows computer has exactly one group of settings stored locally, called the local Group Policy object.

See also: Group Policy; object; policy
guest account
A built-in account used to log on to a computer running Windows when a user does not have an account on the computer or domain, or in any of the domains trusted by the computer's domain.

See also: domain
GUID partition table (GPT)
A disk-partitioning scheme that is used by the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) in Itanium-based computers. GPT offers more advantages than master boot record (MBR) partitioning because it allows up to 128 partitions per disk, provides support for volumes up to 18 exabytes in size, allows primary and backup partition tables for redundancy, and supports unique disk and partition IDs (GUIDs).

See also: Itanium; Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI); master boot record (MBR)
Hhalf-duplex
A system capable of transmitting information in only one direction at a time over a communications channel.

See also: duplex; full-duplex
handle
In the user interface, an interface added to an object that facilitates moving, sizing, reshaping, or other functions pertaining to an object. In programming, a pointer to a pointer, that is, a token that lets a program access an identified resource.

handle count
In Task Manager, the number of object handles in a process's object table.

See also: Task Manager
handshaking
A series of signals acknowledging that communication can take place between computers or other devices. A hardware handshake is an exchange of signals over specific wires (other than the data wires), in which each device indicates its readiness to send or receive data. A software handshake consists of signals transmitted over the same wires used to transfer data, as in modem-to-modem communications over telephone lines.

handwriting input device
A tool, such as a digital pen and tablet, used to enter text by writing instead of typing. Along with writing tablets, you can use 3-D drawing or Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) tablets, or a tablet-PC. You can also write by moving your mouse on the mouse pad.

handwriting recognition
The ability to interpret handwritten text and convert it into computer-readable text. Handwriting recognition programs allow you to enter text using a pen stylus or other handwriting input device, rather than a keyboard.

hard disk
A device, also called hard disk drive, that contains one or more inflexible platters coated with material in which data can be recorded magnetically with read/write heads. The hard disk exists in a sealed case that protects it and allows the head to fly 10 millionths to 25 millionths of an inch above the surface of a platter. Data can both be stored and accessed much more quickly than on a floppy disk.

hardware
The physical components of a computer system, including any peripheral equipment such as printers, modems, and mouse devices.

hardware compression
A feature available on some tape devices that automatically compresses the data that is being stored on the device. This is usually an option that is turned on or off in a backup program.

hardware configuration
Resource settings that have been allocated for a specific device. Each device on your computer has a hardware configuration, which may consist of IRQ lines, DMA, an I/O port, or memory address settings.

See also: device; direct memory access (DMA); input/output (I/O) port; interrupt request (IRQ) lines; memory address
hardware decoder

See also: device
hardware type
A classification for similar devices. For example, Imaging Device is a hardware type for digital cameras and scanners.

See also: device
hash
A fixed-size result that is obtained by applying a one-way mathematical function (sometimes called a hash algorithm) to an arbitrary amount of data. If there is a change in the input data, the hash changes. The hash can be used in many operations, including authentication and digital signing. A hash is also called a message digest.

See also: authentication; hash algorithm
hash algorithm
An algorithm used to produce a hash value of some piece of data, such as a message or session key. A good hash algorithm has a quality where changes in the input data can change every bit in the resulting hash value; for this reason, hashes are useful in detecting any modification in a large data object, such as a message. Furthermore, a good hash algorithm makes it computationally infeasible to construct two independent inputs that have the same hash. Typical hash algorithms include MD2, MD4, MD5, and SHA-1. Hash algorithm is also called a hash function.

See also: Hash-based Message Authentication Mode (HMAC); MD2; MD4; MD5; message digest; Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)
Hash-based Message Authentication Mode (HMAC)
A mechanism for message authentication using cryptographic hash functions. HMAC can be used with any iterative cryptographic hash function (for example, MD5 and SHA-1) in combination with a secret shared key. The cryptographic strength of HMAC depends on the properties of the underlying hash function.

See also: hash algorithm; MD5; Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)
hexadecimal
A base-16 number system represented by the digits 0 through 9 and the uppercase or lowercase letters A (equivalent to decimal 10) through F (equivalent to decimal 15).

hibernation
A state in which your computer shuts down after saving everything in memory on your hard disk. When you bring your computer out of hibernation, all programs and documents that were open are restored to your desktop.

See also: standby
High Contrast
A display feature that instructs programs to change the color scheme to a high-contrast scheme and to increase legibility whenever possible.

histogram
A chart consisting of horizontal or vertical bars, the widths or heights of which represent the values of certain data.

hive
A section of the registry that appears as a file on your hard disk. The registry subtree is divided into hives (named for their resemblance to the cellular structure of a beehive). A hive is a discrete body of keys, subkeys, and values that is rooted at the top of the registry hierarchy. A hive is backed by a single file and a .log file, which are in the systemroot\System32\Config or the systemroot\Profiles\username folders. 

By default, most hive files (Default, SAM, Security, and System) are stored in the systemroot\System32\Config folder. The systemroot\Profiles folder contains the user profile for each user of the computer. Because a hive is a file, it can be moved from one system to another. However, you must use the Registry Editor to edit the file.


See also: registry; key; systemroot
home folder
A folder (usually on a file server) that administrators can assign to individual users or groups. Administrators use home folders to consolidate user files onto specific file servers for easy backup. Home folders are used by some programs as the default folder for the Open and Save As dialog boxes. Home folders are sometimes referred to as home directories.

See also: administrator; group
host
A Windows computer that runs a server program or service used by network or remote clients. For Network Load Balancing, a cluster consists of multiple hosts connected over a local area network (LAN).

See also: client; cluster; local area network (LAN); server; service
host name
The DNS name of a device on a network. These names are used to locate computers on the network. To find another computer, its host name must either appear in the Hosts file or be known by a DNS server. For most Windows computers, the host name and the computer name are the same.

See also: DNS Server; Domain Name System (DNS)
host priority
For Network Load Balancing, a host's precedence for handling default network traffic for TCP and UDP ports. It is used if a host within the cluster goes offline, and it determines which host within the cluster will assume responsibility for the traffic previously handled by the offline host.

See also: cluster; host; User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
Hosts file
A local text file in the same format as the 4.3 Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) UNIX /etc/hosts file. This file maps host names to IP addresses, and it is stored in the \%Systemroot%\System32\Drivers\Etc folder.

See also: systemroot
hot docking
The process of attaching a laptop computer to a docking station while the computer is running, and automatically activating the docking station's video display and other functions.

See also: dock; docking station; undock
HTTP

See definition for: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
hub
A common connection point for devices in a network. Typically used to connect segments of a local area network (LAN), a hub contains multiple ports. When data arrives at one port, it is copied to the other ports so that all segments of the LAN can see the data.

See also: local area network (LAN); port; switching hub
hubbed mode
A mode in which the ARP/MARS provides ATM addresses to requesting clients in the form of a multicast server (MCS) list value. In this mode, the ARP/MARS acts as a multicast server, providing active forwarding of all multicast and broadcast traffic destined for IP addresses contained within the ranges specified in the list.

See also: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP); Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM); multicast address resolution service (MARS); multicast server (MCS); nonhubbed mode; IP address
hue
The position of a color along the color spectrum. For example, green is between yellow and blue. This attribute can be set using Display in Control Panel.

See also: saturation
hyperlink
Colored and underlined text or a graphic that you click to go to a file, a location in a file, an HTML page on the World Wide Web, or an HTML page on an intranet. Hyperlinks can also go to newsgroups and to Gopher, Telnet, and FTP sites. 

In Windows folders, hyperlinks are text links that appear in the folder's left pane. You can click these links to perform tasks, such as moving or copying a file, or to go to other places on your computer, such as the My Documents folder or Control Panel.


Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
A simple markup language used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML files are simple ASCII text files with codes embedded (indicated by markup tags) to denote formatting and hypertext links.

See also: American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
The protocol used to transfer information on the World Wide Web. An HTTP address (one kind of Uniform Resource Locator [URL]) takes the form: http://www.microsoft.com.

Iicon
A small image displayed on the screen to represent an object that can be manipulated by the user. Icons serve as visual mnemonics and allow the user to control certain computer actions without having to remember commands or type them at the keyboard.

IEEE 1394
A standard for high-speed serial devices such as digital video and digital audio editing equipment.

See also: device
IEEE 1394 connector
A type of connector that enables you to connect and disconnect high-speed serial devices. An IEEE 1394 connector is usually on the back of your computer near the serial port or the parallel port. 

If a device is IEEE 1394 compatible, you can connect the device to the IEEE 1394 connector while the computer is running and Windows will detect the device and inform you when it is ready for use. Similarly, you can unplug the device while the computer is running, but you should use the Add Hardware Wizard to inform Windows that you are unplugging the device. Windows will then inform you when the device can be unplugged from the computer.
