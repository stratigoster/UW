"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937) is an animated family film by The Walt 
Disney Company in which a jealous queen tries to have her stepdaughter murdered,
but instead the girl is given shelter by seven dwarves who live deep in a forest.
(The movie's title uses the word "dwarfs," not "dwarves.")

The movie was adapted by Dorothy Ann Blank, Richard Creedon, Merrill De Maris, 
Otto Englander, Earl Hurd, Dick Rickard, Ted Sears and Webb Smith from the fairy
tale from the Brothers Grimm. The names of the dwarves (Bashful, Doc, Dopey, 
Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy and Sneezy) were created for this production. The film was
directed by David Hand.

Walt Disney had to mortgage his house to pay for the film's production. "Snow 
White and the Seven Dwarfs" was the first full-length animated feature and won 
an honorary Academy Award for Walt Disney "as a significant screen innovation 
which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field." 
Disney received a full-size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones, presented 
to him by Shirley Temple.

The movie was also nominated for Best Music, Score. Well-known songs from the 
film include: "Heigh-ho! Heigh-ho! (It's off to work we go)," "Some Day My Prince 
Will Come," and "Whistle While You Work."

There is an easy way to remember the names of the dwarves. There are three 
emotions (Happy, Grumpy, Bashful), two D's (Dopey, Doc), and two S's (Sleepy, 
Sneezy).
