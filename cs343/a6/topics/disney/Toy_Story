Toy Story is a computer-generated imagery (CGI) animation film by The Walt 
Disney Company and Pixar released in theaters on November 21, 1995. Followed 
by "Toy Story 2" in 1999, the video "Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure
Begins" in 2000 and the TV series "Buzz Lightyear of Star Command" also in 2000. 
The latter two featured traditionally animated renditions of Buzz Lightyear and 
Little Green Men (LGM) characters from the first movie.

This movie is Disney's first feature-length completely computer-animated movie. 
It is also Pixar's first feature to be released in theaters. It grossed 
US$356,800,000 worldwide, making it the 65th highest- grossing movie in history 
(not adjusted for inflation). The primary characters are toys in the room of the

baby sister and mother have smaller roles as do the neighbor Sid, his dog Scud 
and sister Hannah.

Characters

Warning: Plot details follow.

The main toy characters are:

his pull string he says things like "There's a snake in my boot!" and "Someone's 
poisoned the water hole!" He is Andy's favorite toy, with a special spot on the 
bed, and as such is the leader of the toys. 

Potato - (voice Don Rickles) a Mr. Potato Head doll by Hasbro, Inc.

Rex- (voice Wallace Shawn) a Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaur with a lot of anxiety 
from an inferiority complex (afraid he is not scary.) 

Slinky Dog- (voice Jim Varney) a wiener dog with a Slinky abdomen. Very loyal to
Woody. 

Hamm- (voice John Ratzenberger) a Piggy Bank.

 Buzz Lightyear - (voice Tim Allen) a Space Ranger from Star Command. A new 
plastic toy with electronic voice, spring loaded wings,laser (a blinking LED) 
and a rocket ship box. Buzz was a gift at Andy's birthday party. Buzz doesn't
know he is a toy.

Other toy characters include:

Little Bo Peep - (voice Annie Potts) a shepherdess doll, Woody's romantic 
interest.

Plot

The movie starts with a meeting among the toys to discuss the family's upcoming 
move. At the end of the meeting it is announced that today is Andy's birthday 
party. This results in pandemonium from the other toys. Everyone one is afraid 
they will be replaced. Woody of course is calm since he is Andy's favorite and 
would never be replaced.

Finally, to calm everyone down Woody sends a reconnaissance group of little 
green toy soldiers using a baby monitor to scout the party. There are no new 
toys at the party, until mom pulls out another box, but the soldiers are cut off
and we don't hear what it is, only that the kids are coming upstairs. All the 
toys rush to their places before Andy returns.

When Andy arrives, Woody is brushed out of his place- the middle of the bed- and
on to the floor to make space for the new toy. Once the kids leave to eat cake, 
Woody climbs back on the bed to see who this is that could have displaced him.

A conflict between Woody and Buzz develops with Woody's jealousy that Buzz 
displaces him, and his irritation with the fact Buzz does not know he is a toy. 
This conflict results in Woody and Buzz ending up in a situation where the only 
way out is for them to work together.
