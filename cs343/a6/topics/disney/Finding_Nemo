"Finding Nemo" is a computer-animated movie produced by Pixar for The Walt 
Disney Company and released in  2003. "Finding Nemo" set a record as the highest
grossing opening weekend for an animated feature, making $70 million (surpassed
in 2004 by "Shrek 2"). From there, it wound up becoming the highest grossing 
animated film of all time, eclipsing the record set by "The Lion King". By March 
2004, it was one of the top ten highest-grossing films ever, having earned over 
US$ 850,000,000. The film received an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature 
Film in 2004.

The title character's name alludes to Captain Nemo, the submarine captain in two
of Jules Verne's<LINK>art:pages/art/Jules_Verne</LINK> novels: "20,000 Leagues
under the Sea" <LINK>art:pages/art/Captain_Nemo</LINK> and "The Mysterious Island".

Plot

The film tells the story of a widowed fish named Marlin, who one day manages to 
misplace his only son, Nemo. Nemo is captured by recreational scuba divers. One 
of them, who's a dentist, leaves Nemo in his clinic aquarium, along with the 
other exotic fishes he's captured before.

Teaming up with the scatterbrained Dory, Marlin ventures across the ocean to 
Australia, in the hopes of being able to rescue his son from the dentist's 
aquarium.

Mr. Ray sings a song "The Zones of the Open Sea" (about the different biological
regions of the ocean), a parody of Tom Lehrer's periodic table song.

The film's prominent use of clownfish prompted mass purchase of the animals for 
children's pets in the United States (even though the movie portrayed the use of
fish as pets negatively). At the same time, the film had a central theme that 
"all drains lead back to the ocean." (A main character escapes from imprisonment
by going down a sink drain and ending up in the sea.) This caused many children
to flush their living fish down toilets in imitation of the picture. Major sewage
companies teamed with Disney to release press statements that attempted to 
address the situation with humor. "Although all drains DO lead to water," they 
read, "said water always passes through a turbine before leading to the ocean. As
such, in real life the film would more accurately be titled 'Grinding Nemo'"[1]

French children's book author Franck Le Calvez sued Disney, claiming that the 
story and the characters were stolen from his book "Pierrot Le Poisson-Clown"
(Pierrot the Clownfish). The idea of Pierrot (which, in Le Calvez's first plans,
ought to become an animation film) was protected in 1995 and the book was 
released in France in November 2002. Franck Le Calvez and his lawyer, Pascal 
Kamina, demanded from Disney a share of the profits from merchadising articles 
sold in France. Le Calvez and Kamina lost the process on March 12, 2004, but 
intend to file an appeal on October 5.
