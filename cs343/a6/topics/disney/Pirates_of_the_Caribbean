"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is a movie of adventure
and romance set in the Caribbean during the seventeenth century. It is based on 
the amusement rides of the same name (minus the subtitle) at Disneyland and Walt
Disney World. This movie stars Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, 
Geoffrey Rush, and Jack Davenport. It is directed by Gore Verbinski and produced
by Jerry Bruckheimer.

It was released on July 9, 2003. As of March 16, 2004, it had grossed at the box
office more than $653 million worldwide; the 18th highest grossing movie ever. It
proved to be a success for Walt Disney Pictures and within weeks of release they
announced a sequel was in development, "Pirates of the Caribbean 2", slated for
release in 2005/6.

When production for the film was first announced in early 2002, movie fans and 
critics were skeptical of its chances of being a success. The concept of Disney
basing a movie upon one of its own theme park rides seemed to many a crass 
marketing ploy. Critics were pleasantly surprised to find the film an enjoyable
swashbuckler. However, the poor reception received by other Disney films based
upon its theme park rides ("The Country Bears", "The Haunted Mansion") suggested
that the success of "Pirates of the Caribbean" was an exception and not the rule.

Script

Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio ("Shrek", "The Mask of Zorro") and others created a
script noted for its witty lines and challenge-response jokes. Two examples:

   1. Barbossa: There are a lot of long words in there, Miss; we're
      naught but humble pirates. What is it that you want?
      His supposed dislike of long words is contradicted a few lines
      later by him saying:
      Barbossa: I'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request.
      This suggests to the audience that if he lied about the long
      words, maybe they aren't "but humble pirates" either.
   2. Norrington: You are without doubt the worst pirate I've ever heard of.
      Jack : But you have heard of me.

The wordplay was well suited to both Geoffrey Rush's and especially
Johnny Depp's unusual style and worked well throughout the film.
