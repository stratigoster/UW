The Walt Disney Company (also known as Disney Enterprises, Inc. or 
simply "Disney") was founded in 1923 by Walt Disney and is one of the largest 
media and entertainment corporations in the world. The company's corporate 
headquarters are located in Burbank, California. Disney had revenues of 22 
billion USD in 2002. It trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the 
symbol 'DIS'. The company was originally named Walt Disney Productions; the name 
was changed on February 6, 1986.

Its movie studios include Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood 
Pictures, Miramax Films, and Dimension Films. Disney also owns the American 
Broadcasting Company (ABC) television network (since 1996), The Disney Channel, 
and ESPN's family of cable television networks. Disney's music division includes
Walt Disney Records, Mammoth Records, Lyric Street Records, and Hollywood 
Records. The company operates the Disney Vacation Club resorts and ESPN Zone 
restaurants. It owns Hyperion Books, Disney Publishing Worldwide and the Walt 
Disney Cruise Line.

Disney operates many resorts and theme parks at Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney 
World Resort, Disneyland Resort Paris, and Tokyo Disney Resort. Hong Kong 
Disneyland is under construction and set to open in 2005. Disney uses its own 
terminology at its theme parks: park customers are called "guests," Disney 
employees are called "cast members," any area which can be reached or seen by a 
customer is "onstage," and employees-only areas are "backstage." Newly-hired cast 
members go through a course named "Traditions" in which the four "keys" of the 
theme parks--Safety, Courtesy, Efficiency, and Show--are taught, along with 
instructions such as "When pointing out something to a guest, always use two 
fingers or your entire hand, never a single finger."

The company also owns the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim hockey team and owned the 
Anaheim Angels baseball team, which was later sold to businessman Arturo Moreno.
It also handles licensing of Disney products and sales through the Disney Store, 
Disney Publishing, and Disney Interactive.

Some librarians have objected to Disney's lobbying of the world's major 
legislative bodies into passing repeated retroactive copyright term extensions, 
calling it "manipulative" and "absurd". As well as the general limitation on the 
public domain that this implies, critics are quick to point out that Disney has 
made much of its fortune from stories that have passed out of copyright, such as
Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty.

After witnessing the box office failures of some of its recent animated films 
and the stellar successes of computer-animated films from Pixar, Disney has 
decided to shift its production from "traditional" hand-drawn animated films 
(which in recent years have incorporated much work done on computer) entirely to
computer-animated films. The last traditionally-animated film produced by Disney 
was "Home on the Range." Its first computer-animated film will be "Chicken 
Little." Disney has fallen under much criticism for this change in direction, 
especially as fans see the strength of a movie as its plot and its characters 
and not as the technology used to make it. Additionally, by laying off all of 
its hand-drawn animation staff, Disney has released into the job market a large 
number of skilled artists who have a grudge against their former company and who
could be very attractive to Disney's competitors. Disney is becoming a direct 
competitor to Pixar in a market dominanted by the latter. Disney has failed to 
renew its contract with Pixar to release Pixar's films under the Disney name, an
arrangement which had been extremely profitable to Disney and whose termination 
means that Pixar is now free to pair up with a competing studio.
