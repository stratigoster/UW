In the context of computer networking, cracking (also called black-hat hacking, 
or hacking) is the act of compromising the security of a system without 
permission from an authorized party, usually with the intent of accessing 
computers connected to the network. (The somewhat similar activity of defeating 
copy protection devices in software with the intent of using the software 
illegally is addressed at software cracking.) The term 'cracker' seems to have 
developed from 'hacker,' with a connotation of forcibility in addition to 
cleverness.

Cracking techniques can vary from using advanced programming skills and social 
engineering<LINK>security:pages/security/Social_engineerint_computer_security</LINK>
to utilizing software developed by others without understanding how the cracking 
software works. The latter type of cracker is often referred to as a "script 
kiddie".<LINK>pop_culture:pages/pop_culture/Leet</LINK> (Unskilled crackers are
far more common than highly skilled ones.) Common software weaknesses exploited
by crackers include buffer overflows and heap overflows.
