In the cracking scene of the 1980s, demon dialing was the act of using a modem 
to dial every telephone number in a local area to find out where computers are 
available, then attacking them, trying to gain access by guessing passwords.

Demon dialing was made famous in the movie "War Games",
<LINK>art:pages/art/War_Games</LINK> in which the protagonist sets up his phone
to call every phone line in another state until he reaches another modem, from
which he can crack into more systems.  Since the movie's release, demon dialing
has been popularly known in some circles as war dialing,

Similar to demon dialing is a port scan under TCP/IP, which "dials" every TCP 
port of every IP address to find out what services are available, then attacking
them by guessing passwords or by exploiting vulnerabilities in software that runs
with elevated privileges.
