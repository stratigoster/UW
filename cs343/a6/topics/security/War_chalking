Warchalking is the drawing of symbols in public places to advertise an open 
Wi-Fi wireless network.

Inspired by hobo symbols, the warchalking symbols were conceived by a group of 
friends in June 2002 and publicised by Matt Jones. The word is ultimately a 
reference to the 1983 film "War Games" <LINK>art:pages/art/War_Games</LINK>. The
film showed a cracker using software to dial all the numbers in specific exchanges 
sequentially in the hope of finding a modem. This technique became known as
"wargames dialing" (sometimes erroneously identified as "wardialing;"
<LINK>security:pages/security/War_dialing</LINK> see also demon dialing
<LINK>security:pages/security/Demon_dialing</LINK>), from which "warchalking" was
later derived.

Having found a Wi-Fi node, the warchalker draws a special symbol on a nearby 
piece of public furniture, such as a wall, the pavement, or a lamp post. Anyone 
initiated in the ways of warchalking will recognise what it means and get 
online. In certain cities, the word "bellum" indicates the presence of an open 
node. If the node is later protected by some means such as encryption or if the 
node is no longer existent, the word "bellum" should be crossed out and replaced 
with the word "pax". These words are Latin for "war" and "peace" respectively.
