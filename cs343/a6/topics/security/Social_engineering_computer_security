In the field of computer security, social engineering is the practice of conning
people into revealing sensitive data on a computer system, often on the Internet.
With the profusion of poorly-secured computers with known security holes 
connected to the Internet, the majority of security compromises are now done by 
exploiting such; however, social engineering attacks remain extremely common and
area way to attack systems protected against other methods---for instance, 
computers which are not connected to the Internet. It is an article of faith 
amongst experts in the field that "users are the weak link."

A contemporary example of a social engineering attack is the use of e-mail 
attachments that contain malicious payloads (that, for instance, use the 
victim's machine to send massive quantities of spam). After earlier malicious 
e-mails led software vendors to disable automatic execution of attachments, 
users now have to explicitly activate attachments for this to occur. Many users,
however,will blindly click on any attachments they receive, thus allowing the 
attack to work.

Another approach is dumpster-diving for a piece of paper with a username and 
password on it.

Perhaps the simplest, but still effective attack is tricking a user into 
thinking one is an administrator and requesting a password for debugging 
purposes. Users of Internet systems frequently receive messages that request 
password or credit card information in order to "set up their account" 
or "reactivate settings" or some other benign operation in what are called 
phishing<LINK>security:pages/security/Phishing</LINK> attacks. Users of these
systems must be warned early and frequently to not divulge sensitive information,
passwords or otherwise, to people claiming to be administrators. In reality,
administrators of computer systems rarely, if ever, need to know the user's
password to perform administrative tasks. However, even this might not be
necessary--in an Infosecurity survey, 90% of office workers gave away their
password in exchange for a cheap pen.

Training users about security policies and ensuring that they are followed is 
the primary defence against social engineering.

One of the most famous social engineers in recent history is Kevin Mitnick.
