War dialing was a technique in the 1980s and '90s by which a computer would 
repeatedly dial a number (usually to a crowded modem pool) in an attempt to gain
access immediately after another user had hung up.

The term (and the technique) pre-date the movie "War Games"
<LINK>art:pages/art/War_Games</LINK> by several years. However, the popularity of
the film among computer enthusiasts led to the term being commonly used for what
is more precisely known as demon dialing,
<LINK>security:pages/security/Demon_dialing</LINK> which figures prominently in
the movie. The expansion of accessible ISP connectivity since that time more or
less rendered the practice obsolete, and today "war dialing" much more frequently
refers to demon dialing.

An identical technique was sometimes used to get the first call for prizes in 
radio "call-in" shows, thus leading to the adoption of random "fifth 
caller," "seventeenth caller" etc. by radio stations to circumvent this practice.

Toneloc was a famous war dialing software for MS-DOS.
