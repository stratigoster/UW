Idouard Manet (January 23, 1832 - April 30, 1883) was a noted French painter. 
One of the first nineteenth-century artists to approach modern-life subjects, 
his works bridged the gap between realism and Impressionism.

Idouard Manet was born in Paris, France; his mother, Euginie-Desirie Fournier, 
was the goddaughter of a Swedish prince, and his father, Auguste Manet, was a 
French judge. He wanted Idouard to also pursue a career in law, but Idouard 
wanted a career in the arts. His uncle, Charles Fournier, encouraged him to 
pursue painting seriously; he often took young Idouard to exhibitions at the 
Louvre.

From 1850 to 1856, after failing his naval examinations, Manet went to study 
under academic painter Thomas Couture. He would copy the Old Masters in the 
Louvre in his spare time. He spent some time visiting Germany, Italy and the 
Netherlands, during which he absorbed the influences of the Dutch painter Frans 
Hals and the Spanish artists Diego Velasquez and Francisco Josi de Goya.

Manet, in imitation of the current style of Realism initiated by Gustave 
Courbet, painted many everyday subjects like beggars, cafis, bullfights, and 
other events and scenery. He produced very few religious, mythological, or 
historical paintings.

One of Manet's most famous paintings at this time is "Le dijeuner sur l'herbe"
("The Lunch on the Grass"), originally exhibited as "Le Bain" ("The Bath"). The 
Salon refused to exhibit it in 1863 but he exhibited it at the "Salon des 
Refusis" ("Exhibition of Refused Works") later in the year. Its juxtaposition of
dressed men and a nude woman was controversial, as was its abbreviated 
sketch-like style--an innovation that distinguished Manet from Courbet. However,
Manet's composition derived from Raphael's "Judgement of Paris" and 
Giorgione's "Concert Champetre", both of which included naked women beside fully 
dressed men. Manet was taking respected works by Renaissance artists and 
updating them, a practice he had also adopted in "Olympia", a nude portrayed in a
style that recalled the early studio photographs of the day, but which was based 
on Titian's "Venus of Urbino". The foreground nude is Victorine Meurent, Manet's 
favourite model. The two men are one of Manet's brothers and Rodolphe Leenhoff, 
Manet's future brother-in-law.

The roughly-painted style and 'photographic' lighting in these works was seen as 
specifically modern, and as a challenge to the Renaissance works Manet updated. 
Manet consistently believed that modern artists should seek to exhibit at the 
Salon rather than abandon it. He became friends with the Impressionists Edgar 
Degas, Claude Monet,<LINK>art:pages/art/Claude_Monet</LINK> Pierre-Auguste Renoir,
<LINK>art:pages/art/Pierre-Auguste_Renoir</LINK> Alfred Sisley, Paul Cizanne,
<LINK>art:pages/art/Paul_Cezanne</LINK> and Camille Pissarro <LINK>art:pages/art/Pissarro</LINK>
in part through his sister-in-law Berthe Morisot, who was a member of the group.
His own work had influenced and anticipated the Impressionist style. However, 
Manet resisted involvement in Impressionist exhibitions, partly because he did 
not wish to be seen as the representative of a group identity, and partly because
of his disapproval of their opposition to the Salon system. Nevertheless, when 
Manet was excluded from the International exhibition of 1867, he set up his own 
exhibition.

However, he was influenced by the Impressionists, especially by Monet, and to an
extent Morisot. Manet was influenced to use lighter colors. Nevertheless he 
retained his distinctive use of blocks of black, uncharacteristic of other 
Impressionists. He painted many "plein air" studies--paintings created outdoors--
but always returned to what he considered serious work in the studio.

Throughout his life, though resisted by art critics, Manet had many champions. 
He knew Zola, who supported him publicly in the press, and Mallarmi, as well as 
Baudelaire, who had challenged him to depict life as it was. He in turn made 
many sketchings of them.

In 1881, under pressure from his friend Antonin Proust, Idouard Manet was 
awarded the Legion of Honor by the French government. His last major work, "Le 
Bar aux Folies-Berghre" ("A Bar at the Folies-Berghre"), was painted in 1881-2. 
It was exhibited at the Salon that same year.

Manet died of untreated syphilis, which caused him much pain and partial 
paralysis from locomotor ataxia in his late days. His left foot was amputated 
because of gangrene eleven days before he died.

He died in Paris in 1883 and is buried in the Cimetihre de Passy, Paris, France.

In recent years, the price for his works exceeded US$26 million.
