"The Name of the Rose", a 1980 novel by Umberto Eco, is a murder mystery set in
an Italian monastery in the year 1327. The book was also made into a film in 1986,
directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud and starring Sean Connery as the intrepid 
Franciscan monk, William of Baskerville.

Warning: Plot details follow.

Along with his apprentice "Adso of Melk" (named after the Benedictine monastery 
Stift Melk and played by Christian Slater), William journeys to an abbey where a
murder has been committed. As the plot unfolds, several other people mysteriously
die. Our heroes explore a medieval library, the subversive power of laughter and 
come face to face with the Inquisition.

The name of the central character, William of Baskerville, alludes both to the 
fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and to William of Ockham, who first put 
forward the principle known as "Ockham's Razor": that one should always accept 
the simplest explanation that covers the facts. The name of the narrator, his 
sidekick Adso, is among other things a pun on Simplicio from Galileo Galilei's 
Dialogue; Adso= ad S implici o ("to Simplicio"). It is also a play on Holmes' 
friend Dr. Watson.

On one level, the book is an excellent exposition of the scientific method. 
William demonstrates the power of deductive reasoning. He refuses to accept the 
diagnosis of "simple demonic possession" despite the fact that at that time 
demonology was the ruling scientific paradigm. He keeps an open mind, collecting
facts and observations, following even pure intuition as to what he should 
investigate. The story also demonstrates the crucial importance of chance in any
investigative endeavour. Nevertheless, William could not have solved the cases 
if he had not properly prepared a framework of facts and interconnections, which
the chance discovery then made meaningful.

The book meticulously describes monastic life in the 14th century. The action 
takes place at a Benedictine abbey during the controversy between branches of 
Franciscans. The spirituals abhor wealth, bordering on the Dulcinian 
heresy.

As usual in Eco's novels, there is a display of erudition. The blind librarian 
Jorge from Burgos is a pun on Jorge Luis Borges. Borges wrote a short story, The
Library of Babel, which inspired the secret library in Eco's book. Throughout the
book, there are Latin quotes, authentic and apocryphal. There are also 
discussions of the philosophy of Aristotle and of a variety of heresies, 
especially those associated with the fraticelli. <LINK>history:pages/history/Fraticelli</LINK>
