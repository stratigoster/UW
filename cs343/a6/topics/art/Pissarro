Camille Pissarro (July 10, 1830 - November 13, 1903) was a French impressionist 
<LINK>art:pages/art/Impressionism</LINK>painter.

Camille Pissarro was born in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands on July 10, 1830. He 
moved to Paris, France in 1855 and studied there with the French landscape 
artist Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot.<LINK>art:pages/art/Jean-Baptiste_Camille_Corot</LINK>

Known as the "Father of Impressionism", he painted rural French life, 
particularly landscapes and workers in the fields as well as scenes from 
Montmartre. He then went to Paris to teach where some of his students were Paul 
Cezanne <LINK>art:pages/art/Paul_Cezanne</LINK> and Paul Gauguin.

In March 1893, famous Paris Gallery Durand-Ruel organised a major exhibition of 
46 of Pissarro's works along 55 others by Antonio de La Gandara. But while 
Gandara was acclaimed by the critics, their appraisal of Pissarro's art was less
enthusiastic. During his lifetime, Camille Pissarro was able to sell very few of
hispaintings. Recent sales of some paintings by Pissarro have been in the $4 
million dollar range.

He died in Iragny on November 12, 1903 and was buried in Phre Lachaise, Paris, 
France.
