Captain Nemo is the protagonist of Jules Verne's <LINK>art:pages/art/Jules_Verne</LINK>
novel "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" (1870) and its sequel, "The
Mysterious Island" (1874). He is prince Dakkar, the son of an Indian rajah and
nephew of Tippu Sahib, having a deep hatred of the British conquest of India.
After the Sepoy mutiny, he devotes himself to scientific research and develops
an advanced electric submarine, the Nautilus. He and a crew of his loyals cruise
the seas, battling injustice, especially slavery. The gold of Spanish ships sunk
at the Bay of Vigo provided them with money.

The character appears in the comic book "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" 
and its 2003 feature film adaptation, in which he was played by Naseeruddin 
Shah.

He has also been the subjects of a song by Sarah Brightman and another by the 
band Ace of Base.
