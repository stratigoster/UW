"WarGames" was a 1983 science fiction film written by Lawrence Lasker and Walter
F. Parkes, and directed by John Badham. The film starred Matthew Broderick in
his first major film role as David Lightman, Ally Sheedy as Jennifer Mack,
Dabney Coleman as John McKittrick, and John Wood as Stephen Falken.

The movie was a hit, costing US$12 million, but grossing over$79 million in the 
US alone. The NORAD set was the most expensive single movie set ever built up 
to that time, at the staggering cost of$1 million.

Warning: Plot details follow.

In the film, Broderick, a hacker, uses his 1970s vintage IMSAI microcomputer and
modem (connected to the telephone by an acoustic coupler) to gain access to the 
NORAD military artificial intelligence computer system called WOPR 9 that can 
control the United States' arsenal of ICBMs.

The teenager, unaware of the machine's real purpose, discovers what he believes 
to be a simulation game called "Global Thermonuclear War" and begins to "play." 
Unbeknownst to him, WOPR sets in motion preparations for a real attack against 
the Soviet Union. With the aid of the machine's creator (Wood), disaster is 
narrowly averted when the hacker manages to teach WOPR about the futility of war
by getting it to play endless drawn games of tic-tac-toe against itself which 
segue into cycles through all the nuclear war stategies that WOPR has devised. 
WOPR then learns that "the only winning move is not to play."

It was in part a cautionary tale about technology and the dangers of leaving 
machines in control of unleashing destruction, in an echo of the Doomsday device
of "Dr.Strangelove". It also generalized the idea of the Cold War period in the 
1970s and 1980s that somewhere there was a "button" that when pressed would nuke 
the whole world away (the button, marked "LAUNCH", had several prominent 
close-ups), and its final sequence graphically demonstrated the concept of 
mutual assured destruction (MAD). Also, it was one of the first movies to deal 
with teenage hackers and their activities.

At least one computer/video game was licensed from the "WarGames" movie, 
published in 1983 by THORN EMI Video under the movie's name and the alternative 
name "Computer War". It was released for the Atari 8-bit family and the Commodore
VIC-20,and possibly for other platforms as well.

The user account "Stephen Falken" was present by default for a long time in the 
operating system NetBSD, in homage to "WarGames".
