Victor Hugo (February 26, 1802 - May 22, 1885) was a French author, the most 
important of the Romantic authors in the French language.

Born in Besangon, Doubs in the region of Franche-Comti. One of the most powerful
and popular authors of 19th century France, and a champion of republicanism. 
Lived in exile during the reign of Napoleon III - in Jersey 1852-1855 and in 
Guernsey from 1855 until his return to France in 1870.

Victor Hugo

Major works include novels and a large body of poetry. His death, and the 
spontaneous national mourning which followed, inspired the French government to 
reinvent The Panthion in Paris as a temple in homage to the great men (and, 
eventually, women) of France. He is buried in its necropolis.

Although Hugo is better known to the English-speaking world as a novelist, it 
was as a poet that he broke new ground. The French poetic traditions were as 
well-established in his time as the English ones were before the time of the 
Romantic poets, and Hugo's contribution may be compared with that of Wordsworth.
He believed that the poet's purpose should be two-fold:

    - to echo universal sentiment by revealing his own feelings, uniting the 
      voices of mankind, nature and history. 
    - to guide the reader: "faire flamboyer l'avenir"- to lead the way.

In his epic, "La Ligende des Sihcles", he attempts, by reference to historical 
events, to depict humanity's struggle to emerge from obscurity into 
enlightenment.

Honorary President and founder of the "Association Littiraire et Artistique 
Internationale" (ALAI) in 1878 in Paris which gave itself the objective of 
creating an international convention for the protection of literary and artistic
propertieswhich was achieved eight years later with the Berne Convention on 
September 9, 1886.

Hugo is also one of the primary saints of Cao Dai, a Vietnamese religion.
