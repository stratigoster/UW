Jules Verne (February 8, 1828 - March 24, 1905) was a French writer and a 
pioneer of the science fiction (scientific romance) genre.

Early years

Verne was born in Nantes to attorney Pierre Verne and his wife Sophie. The 
oldest of the family's five children, he spent his early years at home with his 
parents, on a nearby island in the Loire River. This isolated setting helped to 
strengthen both his imagination and the bond between him and his younger brother
Paul. At the age of nine, the pair were sent to boarding school at the 
Nantes lycee.

There Jules studied Latin, which was used later in his short story "Le Mariage de
Monsieur Anselme des Tilleuls" (mid-1850, not yet translated into English). The 
following legend was created by his second French biographer, Marguerite Allotte
de la Fuye: Verne's fascination with adventure asserted itself at an early age, 
inspiring him at one point to stow away on a ship bound for Asia. His voyage was
cut short, however, as he found his father waiting for him at the next port.

Literary debut

After completing his studies at the lycee, Verne went to Paris to study for the
bar. About 1848, in conjunction with Michel Carre, he began writing librettos for
operettas. For some years his attentions were divided between the theatre and 
work, but some travellers' stories which he wrote for the "Musee des Familles" 
seem to have revealed to him the true direction of his talent: the telling of 
delightfully extravagant voyages and adventures to which cleverly prepared 
scientific and geographical details lent an air of verisimilitude.

When Verne's father discovered that his son was writing rather than studying the
law, he promptly withdrew his financial support. Consequently, he was forced to 
support himself as a stockbroker, which he hated, although he was a success at 
it. During this period, he met the authors Alexandre Dumas
<LINK>art:pages/art/Alexandre_Dumas</LINK> and Victor Hugo
<LINK>art:pages/art/Victor_Hugo</LINK>, who offered him some advice on his writing.

It was during this period he met Honorine de Viane Morel, a widow with two 
daughters. They married on January 10, 1857. With her encouragement, he 
continued to write and actively try to find a publisher. On August 4, 1861, 
their son, Michel Jean Pierre Verne, was born. A classic "enfant terrible", he 
married an actress over Verne's objections, and had two children by his underage
mistress. Verne's situation improved when he met Pierre-Jules Hetzel, one of the
most important French publishers of the 19th century, who published also Victor 
Hugo, George Sand, and Erckmann-Chatrian, among others. Hetzel read a draft of 
Verne's story about the balloon exploration of Africa, which had been rejected 
by other publishers on the ground that it was "too scientific". With Hetzel's 
help, Verne rewrote the story and in 1863 it was published in book form as "Cinq 
semaines en ballon" ("Five Weeks in a Balloon").

Verne became wealthy and famous. From that point on, and for nearly a quarter of
a century, scarcely a year passed in which Hetzel did not publish one or more of 
his stories. The most successful of these include: "Voyage au centre de la terre"
("Journey to the Center of the Earth", 1864); "De la terre a la lune" ("From the 
Earth to the Moon", 1865); "Vingt Mille Lieues sous les mers" ("20,000 Leagues 
Under the Seas", 1869) <LINK>art:pages/art/Captain_Nemo</LINK>; and "Le tour du
monde en quatre-vingts jours" ("Around the World in Eighty Days"), which first
appeared in "Le Temps" in 1872. After his first novel, most of his stories were
first serialized in the "Magasin d'Education et de Recreation", a Hetzel biweekly
publication, before being published in the form of books. His brother, Paul
Verne, contributed to the 40th French climbing of the Mont-Blanc, added to his
brother's collection of short stories "Doctor Ox" in 1874. He remains the most
translated novelist in the world, in 148 languages, according to the UNESCO
statistics.

The last years

On March 9, 1886, as Verne was coming home, his nephew, Gaston, charged at him 
with a gun. As the two wrestled for it, it went off. The second bullet entered 
Verne's left shin. He never fully recovered. Gaston spent the rest of his life 
in an asylum.

After the deaths of Hetzel and his beloved mother in 1887, Jules began writing 
works that were darker, such as a story of a lord of a castle infatuated with an
opera singer who turns out to be just a hologram and a recording, and others 
concerned with death. In 1888, he entered politics and was elected town 
councillor of Amiens where he championed several improvements and served for 15 
years. Ill with diabetes, Verne died at his home, 44 Boulevard Longueville, (now
Boulevard Jules-Verne). Michel oversaw publication of his last novels "Invasion of
the Sea" and "The Lighthouse at the End of the World".

In 1863, he wrote a novel called "Paris in the 20th Century" about a young man 
who lives in a world of glass skyscrapers, high-speed trains, gas-powered 
automobiles, calculators, and a worldwide communications network, yet cannot 
find happiness, and comes to a tragic end. Hetzel thought the novel's pessimism 
would damage Verne's then booming career, and suggested he wait 20 years to 
publish it. Verne put the manuscript in a safe, where it was discovered by his 
great-grandson in 1989. It was published in 1994.
