Alexandre Dumas, pere (July 24, 1802-December 5, 1870 was a French novelist.

Alexandre Dumas was born Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie in Villers-Cotterets, 
Aisne, near Paris, France, the grandson of the Marquis Antoine-Alexandre Davy de
laPailleterie.

Origins and early life

While his grandfather served the government of France as General Commissaire in 
the Artillery in the colony of Santo Domingo, (today's Dominican Republic but at
the time a part of Haiti, he married Marie-Cissette Dumas, a black slave. In 
1762, she gave birth to a son, Thomas-Alexandre, and she died soon thereafter.

When the Marquis and his young son returned to Normandy, it was at a time when 
slavery still existed, and the boy suffered as a result of being half black. In 
1786, Thomas-Alexandre joined the French army, but to protect the aristocratic 
family's reputation, he enlisted using his mother's maiden name. Following the 
Revolution in France, the Marquis lost his estates but his mulatto son, 
Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, distinguished himself as a capable and daring soldier 
in <LINK>history:pages/history/Napoleon_Bonaparte</LINK> Napoleon Bonaparte's army, rising
through the ranks to become a General by the age of 31.

General Dumas married Marie-Louise Elizabeth Labouret and in 1802 she gave birth
to their son, Alexandre Dumas, who would become France's most commercially 
successful author. General Dumas died in 1806 when Alexandre was only four, 
leaving a nearly impoverished mother to raise him under difficult conditions. 
Unable to provide her son with much in the way of education, it nonetheless did 
not hinder young Alexandre's love of books and he read everything he could get 
his hands on. Growing up, his mother's stories of his father's brave military 
deeds during the glory years of Napoleon, spawned Alexandre's vivid imagination 
for adventure and heroes. Although poor, the family still had the father's 
distinguished reputation and aristocratic connections and after the restoration 
of the monarchy, twenty-year-old Alexandre Dumas moved to Paris where he 
obtained employment at the Palais-Royal in the office of the powerful duc 
d'Orleans.

Literary career

While working in Paris, Dumas began to write articles for magazines as well as 
plays for the theatre. In 1829 his first play was produced, meeting with great 
public acclaim. The following year his second play proved equally popular and as
aresult, he was financially able to work full time at writing. However, in 1830,
heparticipated in the revolution that ousted King Charles X and replaced him on 
the throne with Dumas' former employer, the duc d'Orleans, who would rule as 
Louis-Philippe, the Citizen King.

Until the mid 1830s, life in France remained unsettled with sporadic riots by 
disgruntled Republicans and impoverished urban workers seeking change. As life 
slowly returned to normal, the nation began to industrialize and with an 
improving economy combined with the end of press censorship, the times turned 
out to be very rewarding for the skills of Alexandre Dumas.

After writing more successful plays, he turned his efforts to novels. Although 
attracted to an extravagant lifestyle, and always spending more than he earned, 
Dumas proved to be a very astute business marketer. With high demand from 
newspapers for serial novels, in 1838, he simply rewrote one of his plays to 
create his first serial novel. Titled "Le Capitaine Paul," it led to his forming 
a production studio that turned out hundreds of stories, all subject to his 
personal input and direction.

In 1840, he married an actress, Ida Ferrier, but continued with his numerous 
liaisons with other women, fathering at least three illegitimate children. One 
of those children, a son named after him, would follow in his footsteps, also 
becoming a successful novelist and playwright. Because of their same name and 
occupation, to distinguish them, one is referred to as Alexandre Dumas pere, 
(French for father) the other as Alexandre Dumas, fils (French for son).

Alexandre Dumas, pere, wrote stories and historical chronicles of high adventure
thatcaptured the imagination of the French public who eagerly waited to purchase
thecontinuing sagas. A few of these works are:

    the D'Artagnan Romances:
       o The Three Musketeers <LINK>art:pages/art/The_Three_Musketeers</LINK> (1844)
       o Twenty Years After (1845)
       o The Vicomte de Bragelonne (1847-1850)- usually split into three parts, 
         of which the last part (which deals with the Man in the Iron Mask is the 
         best-known
    The Count of Monte Cristo <LINK>art:pages/art/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo</LINK> (1844-5)
    The Regent's Daughter (1845)
    Queen Margot (1845)
    Marie Antoinette (1845)
    Joseph Balsamo (1846)
    The Forty-Five Guardsman (1848)
    The Black Tulip (1850)
    The Nutcracker- a revision of Hoffmann's story, later adapted by 
    Tchaikovsky as a ballet
    La Dame de Montsoreau (1860)

His writing earned him a great deal of money, but Dumas was frequently broke and
in debt as a result of spending lavishly on countless women and high living. A 
soft touch, the huge and costly chateau he built was constantly filled with 
strangers who took advantage of his generosity. With King Louis-Philippe ousted 
in another revolt, he was not looked upon as favorably by the newly elected 
President, Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte and in 1851 Dumas finally had to 
flee to Brussels, Belgium to escape his creditors. From there he traveled to 
Russia where French was the second language and his writings were also 
enormously popular.

Dumas spent two years in Russia before moving on to seek adventure and fodder 
for more stories. In March of 1861, the kingdom of Italy was proclaimed, with 
Victor Emmanuel II as its king. For the next three years, Alexandre Dumas would 
be involved in the fight for a united Italy, returning to Paris in 1864.

Despite Alexandre Dumas' success and aristocratic connections, his being of 
mixed-blood would affect him all his life. In 1843, he wrote a short story that 
addressed some of the issues of race and the affects of colonialism. 
Nevertheless, inbred racist attitudes impacted his rightful position in France's
historylong after his death on December 5, 1870.

Posthumous recognition

Buried in the place where he had been born, Alexandre Dumas remained in the 
cemetery at Villers-Cotterets until November 30, 2002. Under orders of the 
French President, Jacques Chirac, his body was exhumed and in a televised 
ceremony, his new coffin, draped in a blue-velvet cloth and flanked by four men 
costumed as the Musketeers: Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan, was 
transported in a solemn procession to the Pantheon of Paris, the great mausoleum
where French luminaries are interred.

In his speech, President Chirac said: "With you, we were D'Artagnan, Monte Cristo
or Balsamo, riding along the roads of France, touring battlefields, visiting 
palaces and castles-- with you, we dream." In an interview following the 
ceremony, President Chirac acknowledged the racism that had existed, saying that
awrong had now been righted with Alexandre Dumas enshrined alongside fellow 
authors Victor Hugo<LINK>art:pages/art/Victor_Hugo</LINK> and Voltaire
<LINK>art:pages/art/Voltaire</LINK>.

The honor recognized that although France has produced many great writers, none 
have been as widely read as Alexandre Dumas. His stories have been translated 
into almost a hundred languages, and has inspired more than 200 motion pictures.

Alexandre Dumas' home outside of Paris, the Chateau Monte Cristo, has been 
restored and is open to the public.
