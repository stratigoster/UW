Pierre-Auguste Renoir (February 25, 1841- December 3, 1919) was a preeminent 
French painter.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir

Pierre-Auguste Renoir was born in Limoges, Haute-Vienne, France, the child of a 
working class family. As a boy, he worked in a porcelain factory where his 
interest in painting led to him painting designs on china. In 1862 he studied 
art in Paris, where he met Alfred Sisley, Frederic Bazille and Claude Monet.

His initial paintings were influenced by the artistry of Eugene Delacroix and 
his close friend Monet who helped Renoir found the Impressionism
<LINK>art:pages/art/Impressionism</LINK> movement. He would go on to become one of the
greatest painters of his time. Today his paintings are probably the most
popular, well-known, and frequently reproduced images in the history of art.

Although Renoir had his first exhibit of paintings in 1864 he did not gain any 
real recognition for another ten years due to the turmoil in Paris as a result 
of the Franco-Prussian War. During the Paris Commune in 1871, Pierre-Auguste 
Renoir was arrested as a government spy. His life was saved when he was 
recognized by one of the Commune leaders, whom Renoir had himself protected on 
another occasion. In the mid 1870s, the first exhibition was held for the new 
impressionist painters and Renoir gained his first great acclaim.

While living and working in Montmartre, he would have an affair with one of his 
models, Suzanne Valadon who would become one of the leading female artists of 
the day. He would later marry Aline Victorine Charigot, with whom he would have 
three sons, one of which, Jean Renoir, would become an important filmmaker. 
After marriage, his work changed when he became very much family oriented and 
was equally as interested in painting individual or family portraits as he was 
in landscapes.

One of the most famous impressionist works by any painter, is his 1876 "Le Bal au
Moulinde la Galette (Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette)", an open-air scene, 
jammed with people, of a popular dance garden on the Butte Montmartre not far 
from where he had been living.

In 1881 he traveled to Algeria, a country he associated with Eugene Delacroix, 
then to Madrid, Spain to see the work of Diego Velazquez and then to Italy to 
see Titian's masterpieces in Florence and the paintings of Raphael in Rome. On 
January 15, 1882 Renoir met composer Richard Wagner at his home in Palermo, 
Sicily. Renoir painted Wagner's portait in just 35 minutes.

One of the most prolific artists ever, over a 60 year period, Pierre-Auguste 
Renoir made several thousand paintings. Even during the last 20 years of his 
life when he was severely hampered by arthritis and wheelchair-bound. He moved 
to the warmer climate of Cagnes-sur-Mer not far from Nice on the Mediterranean 
Sea and continued to paint by using a brush strapped to his arm. He even created
sculptures, dictating to an assistant who worked the clay.

In 1919, Renoir had the extraordinary experience of visiting the Louvre to see 
his paintings hanging with the old masters.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir died in the village of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Provence-Alpes-Ctte
d'Azur, on December 3, 1919.

Renoir has had two paintings sell for more than US$70 million. Below is a photo
