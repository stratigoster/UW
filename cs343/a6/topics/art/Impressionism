Impressionism- (Impressionisme- impression, french)-is a style in painting that 
emerged between the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. The 
followers of Impressionism tried to express immediate impression from the 
environment and nature by emphasizing strongly light in its changing qualities, 
often with an emphasis on the effects of a particular passage of time. 
Impressionism was born in 1860 in France when E. Manet, P.-A. Renoir, and
E. Degas put impressionismin their paintings that depicts the multiforming and
difficult urban life, paintings that were fresh and immediately gained world
reception. Impressionists used different dabs (dope and liquid). A revolution in 
transformation happened in scenery painting, when painters Manet, Pissarro 
<LINK>art:pages/art/Pissarro</LINK>and Sisley developed the ended system of plenner. They
went out to paint outside sceneries (streets, parks...) and received an
opportunity to see and catch the changes of life in the beam of the lambent sun.
They tried to picture and catch the world in the glistening paints, its constant
changes to recreate the unity of man and environment. Impressionists wanted to
show that colors observed in nature were the result of constant changes of
reflection from the beam of the sun. Their paintings must be observed at a
distance in order to capture the impression in them.

Impressionism is still widely practiced today, and has influenced a variety of 
successful movements.
