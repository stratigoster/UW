Paul Cizanne (January 19, 1839 - October 22, 1906), the painter of and from 
Aix-en-Provence, is the bridge from Impressionism <LINK>art:pages/art/Impressionism</LINK>
to Cubism. In paintings such as the 1885 "Mont Sainte-Victoire" and 1887 "Madame
Cizanne" we can see the inspiration for the Cubists and even the Fauvists.

Cizanne began with the light, airy painting of the Impressionists and gradually 
solidified it and made it more architectural. His painting began to concentrate 
on solid forms and on the modelling of these forms in colors.

To early 20th Century Modernists, Cizanne was the founder of modern painting. 
Henri Matisse called him "the father of us all".

Cizanne and the important novelist Imile Zola were friends from childhood and 
youth, but broke in later life over Zola's fictionalized depiction of Cizanne in
the novel "L'Oeuvre" ("The Masterpiece," 1886).

On May 10, 1999, Cizanne's painting "Rideau, Cruchon et Compotier" sold for US$ 
60.5 million, the fourth highest price paid for a painting up to that time.
