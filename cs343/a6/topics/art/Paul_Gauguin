Paul Gauguin (June 7, 1848 - May 9, 1903) was an Impressionist 
<LINK>art:pages/art/Impressionism</LINK>painter.

Born Eughne Henri Paul Gauguin in Paris, France, he descended from Spanish 
settlers in South America and the viceroy of Peru, and spent his early childhood
in Lima. After his education in Orlians, France, Gauguin spent six years sailing 
around the world in the Merchant Marine and then in the French Navy. Upon his 
return to France in 1870, he took a job as a broker's assistant. His guardian, 
Gustave Arosa, a successful businessman and art collector, introduced Gauguin to
the impressionists.

A successful stockbroker, Gauguin became a collector and amateur painter. By 
1884 Gauguin had moved with his family to Copenhagen, where he unsuccessfully 
pursued a business career. Driven to paint full-time, he returned to Paris in 
1885, leaving his family in Denmark. Without adequate subsistence, his wife and 
children were forced to return to her family.

Like his friend Vincent Van Gogh, with whom he spent nine weeks with in Arles 
painting, Paul Gauguin suffered from bouts of depression and at one time 
attempted suicide.

In 1891, financially destitute, he sailed to the Tropics to escape European 
civilization and "everything that is artificial and conventional." He remained 
first in Tahiti and later in the Marquesas Islands for most of the rest of his 
life, returning to France one time only.

He was a very important post-impressionist French painter, whose work helped 
provide the basis of modern art. Gauguin's bold experimentation with coloring 
led directly to the fauvist style of the 20th century.

He is buried in the Atuona Cemetery, Atuona, Hiva-Oa, Iles Marquises, French 
Polynesia.

The record price paid for a Gauguin painting is US$35 million.

Among his approximately 150 significant works are:

Ia Orana Maria (Hail, Mary) 
The Seine in Paris between the Pont d'lina and the Pont de Grenelle; 
Haere Mai; 
In the Vanilla Grove, Man and Horse;

Paul Gauguin's life inspired the famous book "The Moon and Sixpence" by Somerset 
Maugham.
