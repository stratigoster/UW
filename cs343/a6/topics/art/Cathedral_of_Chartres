The Cathedral of Chartres ("Cathedral of Our Lady in Chartres," (French:
Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Chartres), located in Chartres, about 50 miles from
Paris, is considered the finest example in all France of the "high Gothic" 
style of architecture.

Construction of a new building on the Romanesque foundations was begun in 1145, 
but a fire in 1194 destroyed all but the west front of the cathedral (and much 
of the town), so that part is in the "early Gothic" style. The body of the 
cathedral was rebuilt between 1194 and 12201, a remarkably short span for 
medieval cathedrals.

The cathedral has been inscribed by the UNESCO on the list of World Heritage 
Sites in 1979.
