Anatomy (from the Greek "anatome", from "ana-temnein", to cut up), is the branch 
of biology that deals with the structure and organization of living things; thus
there is animal anatomy (zootomy) and plant anatomy (phytonomy). The major 
branches of anatomy include comparative anatomy and human anatomy.

Animal anatomy may include the study of the structure of different animals, when
it is called comparative anatomy<LINK>science:pages/science/Comparative_anatomy</LINK>
or animal morphology, or it may be limited to one animal only, in which case it is 
spoken of as special anatomy.

From a utilitarian point of view the study of humans is the most important 
division of special anatomy, and this human anatomy may be approached from 
different points of view. From that of the medical man it consists of a 
knowledge of the exact form, position, size and relationship of the various 
structures of the human body in health, and to this study the term descriptive 
or topographical human anatomy is given, though it is often, less happily, 
spoken of as Anthropotomy.

An accurate knowledge of all the details of the human body takes years of 
patient observation to gain and is possessed by only a few. So intricate is 
man's body that only a small number of professional human anatomists are 
complete masters of all its details, and most of them specialize on certain 
parts, such as the brain, viscera, etc.; contenting themselves with a good working
knowledge of the rest. Topographical anatomy must be learned by each person for 
himself by the repeated dissection and inspection of the dead human body. It is 
no more a science than a pilot's knowledge is, and, like that knowledge, must be
exact and available in moments of emergency.

From the morphological point of view, however, human anatomy is a scientific and
fascinating study, having for its object the discovery of the causes which have 
brought about the existing structure of Man, and needing a knowledge of the 
allied sciences of embryology or developmental biology, phylogeny,
<LINK>science:pages/science/Phylogeny</LINK> and histology.

Pathological anatomy (or morbid anatomy) is the study of diseased organs, while 
sections of normal anatomy, applied to various purposes, receive special names 
such as medical, surgical, gynaecological, artistic and superficial anatomy. The
comparisonof the anatomy of different races of mankind is part of the science of
physical anthropology or anthropological anatomy. In the present edition of this 
work the subject of anatomy is treated systematically rather than 
topographically. Each anatomical article contains first a description of the 
structures of an organ or system (such as nerves, arteries, heart, etc.), as it 
is found in Man; and this is followed by an account of the development or 
embryology and comparative anatomy or morphology, as far as vertebrate animals 
are concerned; but only those parts of the lower animals which are of interest 
in explaining Man's structure are here dealt with. The articles have a twofold 
purpose; first, to give enough details of man's structure to make the articles 
on physiology, surgery, medicine and pathology intelligible; and, secondly, to 
give the non-expert inquirer, or the worker in some other branch of science, the
chief theories on which the modern scientific groundwork of anatomy is built.

There is a historical type of English poetry called an anatomy, or more 
precisely an amatory anatomy. It is a love sonnet dedicated to describing the 
parts of a lover's anatomy, usually female.
