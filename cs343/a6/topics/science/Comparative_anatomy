Comparative anatomy<LINK>science:pages/science/Anatomy</LINK> is the study of
similarities and differences in organisms. It is closely related to evolutionary
biology (see evolution) and with phylogeny
<LINK>science:pages/science/Phylogeny</LINK> (the evolution of organism
development).

Two major concepts of comparative anatomy:

1. "Homologous structures" are structures (body parts/anatomy) which are similar 
   in different species because the species have a common ancestor. They may not 
   perform the same function. The classic example of this is the forelimb structure
   of cats and whales.

2. "Analogous structures" are structures which are similar in different oragnisms
   because they evolved in a "similar environment" and do not have a common ancestor.
   They usually serve the same purpose or similar purposes. An example is the 
   torpedo body shape of porpoises and sharks. They both evolved in a water 
   environment, but have different ancestors.
