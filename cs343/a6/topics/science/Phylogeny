A phylogeny (or phylogenesis) is the origin and evolution of a set of organisms,
usually species. A major task of systematics is to determine the ancestral 
relationships among known species (both living and extinct), and the most 
commonly used methods to infer phylogenies include cladistics and phenetics.

During the late 19th century, the theory of recapitulation, or Haeckel's 
biogenetic law, was widely accepted. This theory was often expressed as "ontogeny
recapitulates phylogeny",<LINK>science:pages/science/Phylogeny</LINK> i.e. that
the development of an organism exactly mirrors the evolutionary development of
the species. The early version of this hypothesis has since been rejected as
being oversimplified and misleading. However, modern biology recognizes numerous
connections between ontogeny and phylogeny, explains them using evolutionary
theory, and views them as supporting evidence for that theory. See the article on
ontogeny and phylogeny.
