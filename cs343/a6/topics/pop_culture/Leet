Leet (often Eleet, leetspeak, leetspeek, l33t, 31337, or 1337; from "Elite") is 
acipher, or simply a novelty form of English spelling. It is characterized by 
the use of non-alphabet characters to stand for letters bearing a superficial 
resemblance, and by a number of quasi-standard spelling changes such as the 
substitution of "z" for final "s" and "x" for "(c)ks". Leet is traditionally used 
on the Internet and other online communities, such as bulletin board systems, to
complement Internet slang or "chatspeak". Leet is used by crackers, script 
kiddies, gamers, Animators, and even lamers. It has never been popular amongst 
real hackers, who consider it a sign of the immaturity of these communities and 
prefer in their conversation the same cleanliness of syntax as in their code. 
However, leet is still a cultural phenomenon well-known amongst hackers, and 
used (usually in a jocular mode of expression) by many computer professionals 
because of this.

Certain factions maintain that "true" leetspeak is spelled correctly, with the 
exceptions described above. They do not consider the use of extreme short forms 
(such as "b" for"be", or "u" for"you") to be leet or leetspeak; instead, they 
refer to it by such terms as "AOL speak" because they associate such habits with 
people who chat using MSN Messenger or AOL Instant Messenger. Another convention
sometimes associated with leetspeak or Internet chatting is capitalizing every 
other letter (LiKe ThIs), sometimes called "stickycaps". A similar habit involves 
capitalizing every letter except for vowels (LiKe THiS).

Overview

The term "leet" comes from the word "elite". Leet can be either pronounced 
as "leet" (monosyllabic, rhymes with "meat") or by pronouncing the "L" separate 
from the rest of the word as "el eat" (elite). The most probable explanation of 
its origin is from bulletin board systems (BBS's) in the 1980s and early 1990s 
where having "elite" status on a BBS allowed a user access to file areas, games, 
and special chat rooms, often including archives of pirated software, 
pornography, and text files of dubious quality documenting topics such as how to
construct explosives and manufacture illegal drugs.

Leet writing, or "leetspeak" may have developed to defeat keyword scanning used 
by BBS sysops for message boards to discourage the discussion of questionable or
forbiddentopics (such as pornography, pirated software, or cracking).

People who enjoy irony sometimes use "leetspeak" to draw attention to "secrets" 
they believe no one actually cares about. "leetspeak" or "hakspek" that shortens 
text may have been developed to decrease bandwidth usage before the bandwidth 
explosion of the 1990s, but such methods would have had extremely minimal effect
on actual bandwidth usage. It may also have developed as a lazy shorthand for 
typists.

Leet is regaining popularity in SMS (Short Message Service) media. More 
recently, leet has re-entered the mainstream thanks to such webcomics as 
Megatokyo and its character Largo.

Leet is a form of written slang or street talk for the information highway. It 
is sometimes used to create group identity and to obscure meaning from 
outsiders, especially newbies (which may be written "n00bs"). It also establishes
a hierarchy, as more complex forms of leet are increasingly unreadable to the 
untrained eye (consider the phrase "PHr3Ku3N7ly H4s|{3d K0o#St330nZ!": it 
translates to "frequently asked questions". Note the extraneous h in front of 
asked and the construction "teeonz" as meaning "tions"). Simple forms of leet are 
making their way into the mainstream, as employees whose companies use email 
filters resort to creative spellings to prevent swearwords from being censored.

Websites exist that are written entirely in leet. There are also converter 
programs which amusingly render ordinary English text into leet, at varying 
levels of complexity. External links: The l33t surfer

Examples
"warez" for software (typically bootlegged software)
"pr0n" for pornography 
"sploitz" (short for "exploits") known vulnerabilities in computer software 
"script kiddie"- a derogatory term used by computer professionals to 
    denote people who download pre-made automated exploit scripts and who possess
    little actual understanding of how computer software works internally. 
    Another uncommon variant is "skript kiddie"
"0wned"? completely dominated (in a game); 
hacked into (of a computer), in the past tense, this is"0wnz0r3d". This word may
    also be used as a non-leet, conversational slang term. This term is sometimes 
    spelled "pwn" or "pwnz0r3d", and the origin of this variation is said to have 
    derived from a typo (although this explanation is probably apocryphal): a 
    user-created Warcraft level included a message sent to all players in the event 
    of a player's defeat: "(player name) has been owned". However, because P and O 
    are side-by-side in the QWERTY layout, the message is said to have been "(player 
    name) has been pwned", and when the level was released, "pwne"/ entered the 
    l33tsp33k vocabulary
"CC" or"carding" for credit card fraud of one form or another
"eggable" for Unix shell accounts (where one can install and run Eggdrop, an 
    IRC bot)
"r00t" for adminstrator privileges (from the Unix administrator account/root/)
"m4d sk1llz" for hacking talent of one sort or another and also being possessed 
    of great ability in terms of computer games, Webmastering, or flaming. Also
    used for other talents, in "m4d[talent] sk1llz"; "m4d" itself is often used 
    for emphasis (such as in "m4d fragging").
"phreaking" for hacking<LINK>security:pages/security/Phreaking</LINK> telephone systems and 
   other non-internet equipment
"w1k1","w1|<1" or"\^/!|{!" for"wiki"
"n00b" for someone who acts experienced in an area despite little knowledge of
    that area, also occasionally "pr013", short for"proletariat". (Various other
    adjectives abound, these being the most civil of them.) 
    Also "pe0n". They are sometimes said to throw n00ks around in nation role-
    playing games such as NationStates.
"w00t","w007", or"\^/007" or the smiley"\o/" is a common interjection, analogous to
    "Yeah!" or"Yippee!" One view is that it originated as a variant of the 
    interjection "whew". Another view believes that it is from hacking, when a
    hacker would exclaim "Root!" when he got root access. Yet another view is 
    that it originated from an acronym for Want One Of Those. It also may have 
    started as part of the online arena-FPS gaming community (esp. Quake)-- short 
    for "We Own the Other Team". Another possible reason is that it is a somewhat
    flawed acronym for "wow loot" originatining from MUD (multi user dungeon) 
    games when coming across treasure.
"haxor","#4><0|2" for"hacker"-- where the symbols are used to draw rough 
    approximations to letters:>< is an"x",|2 is an "r". It is possible that the
    substitution of "ck" with "x" is an intelligent nod to the Greek letter chi.
    Note that the construction "-xor" or any variation thereof can mean not only
    "-ker" but also "zor" (which is how a majority of English speakers would say
    it). In the phrase "r0x0rz my b0x0rz", which means the object of the phrase
    (usually a game, program, exploit, etc.) is of high quality, "x0rz" in the 
    word "r0x0rz" is almost ignored (pronounced "ks" so that the whole word is
    "rocks") while the "x0rz" on"b0x0rz" is pronounced "kszors". It is important
    to note that while "b0x0rz" appears to be leet for "boxers", it is actually
    from a common leet expression "r0x0r j00r b0x0rz", "b0x0rz" meaning 
    "computers" (sometimes referred to as boxes, or among system administrators,
    boxen). "r0x0rz" is generally pronounced as "roks-ors", which is how it is
    spelled; however, a very small minority pronounce it"rockers", following the
    usage in "hax0rz". The term "r0x0r j00r b0x0r" itself is probably a 
    derivation from "r0x0r j00r s0x0r" ("rocks your socks"). It should be noted
    that although the spelling of leet is fairly standardized, pronunciation 
    differs widely, as does the actual alphabet used. Much depends on which 
    forum, newsgroup, or chat room the leet is being spoken in.
"h4x" for"hacks"
"sux0rz" for "sucks" in "sux0rz my nutz0rz" when one feels pity for someone else,
    or when angry. 
"suxxor" for some other person considered unfriendly, this is also used in
    friendly name calling among gamers.

There are many incarnations of leet, and it is continuously evolving as more 
people add to it, and thus, a single word can be "spelled" in many different 
ways. For example, "phonetic" could be |>|-|0n371><, p|-|0|\|3+1|<, |>h0|\|371<, 
ph0n371k.

"Phonetic" spellings
"d00d" for"dude"
"joo" for "you", also written as "j00" or "_|00"
"ph" for"f", as in "phear" for" fear" (as in"ph34r my l33t skillz") 
b4k4^2 or|34|<4^2 for "baka Ni". Baka is the Japanese word for"idiots" 
    or "stupidity", while Ni is the Japanese word for "two", so it is meant to 
    be read as "Bakaraised to the second power" or"baka squared" (meaning quite
    stupid) (see Baka-Ni t-shirt 
    (/http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/megatokyo/leetware/5aef//)). The term is
    used by the character Ruri Hoshino (as "baka baka") in the anime series 
    Martian Successor Nadesico, but subsequently popularized by MegaTokyo.

Note that in true leet, the following are considered improper. 
"kewl" or "ku" or "ql" for "cool",
"r" for "are",
"u" for "you",
"c" for "see" (giving the common "see you")
"2" for "to" or "too",
"4" for "for" (but note "4" can also represent an "A"),
"8" for "-ate", as "l8r" for "later",
"ne" for "any"

Frequent misspellings

Frequently, common typing errors are also absorbed into leet, such as "yuo" 
for "you", "teh" for "the" (also sometimes used as an intensifier: "He is teh
lame"), "pwn" for "own" (to defeat badly, as in a game: "You got pwned"). For 
instance: _|00 607|\^/|\|3|)-- in other words you got owned, and were the subject 
of major "ownage". The term "0\/\/nze|>" has similar meaning, referring to the 
process of getting "owned".) "smrt" for "smart" (this may also be an intentional 
reference to an episode of "The Simpsons" in which Homer misspells "smart" in 
song: "I am so smart! I am so smart! S-M-R-T! S-M-R-T!... I mean, 
S-M-A-R-T!"), "waht" for "what", "leik" or "liek" for "like" (usually sarcastic) 
German "ist" for "is", often used with word "death". eg. "mp3 ist death", "loose"
for "lose".

Other examples
"WHeRE@Re J00" for "where are you"
"wH4+'S uR nAME" for "what is your name"
"/\/\!|<#''7##+ '|<!77' ~|/\||\|_|$$"-- an example of especially obfuscated 
    leet (see:obfuscated code), this translates to "Mike's leet skills own you".

Leet also draws elements from Engrish, such as "b4k4" ("baka"), a Japanese term 
for "fool". Lately, leet draws more and more from Japanese slang, due to the 
increasing fascination of leet-speakers with it. An exception is the 
Korean "g0s\/", whose parent word became well-known in the West through online 
games of Starcraft with/against the massive population of Korean gamers.

Another common feature of leet is over-exclamation, where a sentence is 
postfixed with "far too many exclamation marks!!!!!!!!!!" In some cases, because 
the exclamation symbol (!) resides on the same key as the number 1, 
over-exclamation can be accidentally typed with extraneous digits, owing to the 
excitement of the typist: "d00d th1s r0x0rz!!!!!11" Additionally, the tilde key 
(~) is used in this fashion: "leik this OwNz!!11!!!~~" Some users have adopted 
this and include it deliberately. A growing phenomenon is deliberately typing 
the "word" "one": "pwnz0r3d!!!!!11oneoneone"; in some cases, this has been 
purposely exaggerated for comic effect, i.e.,/L0l!!!11!eleventy-one1!1!11one1/. 
Interestingly, letter-to-number translations do not often occur within 
these "oneoneone" blocks.

Common letter-to-number or letter-to-symbol translations(subject to a great deal
ofindividual variation):

A 4 or /\ or @ 
G 9 or 6 
M //. or ^^ or |v| or [V] or {V} or |\/| or /\/\ or (u) 
S 5 or $ 
Y Y or '/ or `/ or V/ or \-/ or j 
B 8 or 6 or |3 or |> 
H # or [-] or {=} or <~> or |-| or ]~[ or }{ 
N // or ^/ or |\| or /\/ or [\] or <\> or {\} 
T 7 or + or -|- or 1 Z 2 or z 
C [ or " or < or ( 
I 1 or ! or | 
O 0 or () 
U (_) or |_| or v 
D |) or o| or [) 
J ,| or _| or ; 
P | or |o or |> or |" 
V \/ or < 
E 3 or & 
K |< or |{ or {< 
Q 9 or (,) or <| 
W \/\/ or '// or \^/ or (n) or \V/ 
F |= L 1 or | or |_ 
R |2 or 2 or P\ 
X ><

Note: The word "I" will sometimes be replaced with the word "eye"(3j3).

In recent years, leet has become more and more out of style. The vast majority 
of gamers and internet users today do not use leet as it is seen more as a sign 
of weakness and immaturity rather than coolness or of "having skills" (or sk1llz,
as the case may be). However, many words from leet have survived and become part 
of modern Internet culture, such as "pwned", the common leet misspellings such 
as "teh", and especially the "z" at the end of words, such as "skillz". Another 
prominent example of a surviving leet expression is the ever-popular "woot/w007".
Although using leet speak seriously is out of style, many gamers use it in a 
joking context. "h42 h42, u ar3z s00 1337" or "ph342 m/\ 1337 sk1llz."

Another location for similar text obfuscation is in Multiplayer gaming, 
especially involving other characters from the ASCII set. Some Multiplayer games
allow for users to be kicked out if they are "being lame" or generally annoying 
the crowd, by using a simple command like "!kick username" which works fine as 
long as the username constitutes letters that can be typed with a normal 
keyboard. To prevent some kicks, people may use names such as "Ilm?h H`xsr" which
is difficult to type in, if possible at all.
