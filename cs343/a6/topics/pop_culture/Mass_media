The mass media is the whole body of media reaching large numbers of the public 
via radio, television, movies, magazines, newspapers and the World Wide Web. The
term was coined in the 1920s with the advent of nationwide radio networks, 
mass-circulation newspapers and magazines.

The mass media reaches a mass audience. That audience has been viewed by some 
commentators as forming a mass society with special characteristics, notably 
atomization or lack of social connections, which render it especially 
susceptable to the influence of modern mass media techniques such as advertising
andpropaganda.

During the 20th century, the advent of mass media was driven by technology that 
allowed the massive duplication of material at a low cost. Physical duplication 
technologies such as printing, record pressing and film duplication allowed the 
duplication of books, newspapers and movies at low prices to huge audiences. 
Television and radio allowed the electronic duplication of content for the first
time. Mass media had the economics of linear replication: a single work could 
make money proportional to the number of copies sold, and as volumes went up, 
units costs went down, increasing profit margins further. Vast fortunes were to 
be made in mass media.

We also need to discuss mass media in different countries. Mass media in India

The Internet and mass media

During the last decade of the 20th century, the advent of the World Wide Web 
marked the first era in which any individual could have a means of exposure on 
the scale of mass media. For the first time, anyone with a web site can address 
a global audience, although serving high levels of web traffic is still 
expensive. It is possible that the rise of peer-to-peer technologies may have 
begun the process of making the cost of bandwidth manageable.
