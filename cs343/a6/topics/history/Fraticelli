A medieval Roman Catholic group which can trace its origins to the Franciscan 
Spirituals, but which came into being as a separate entity- and problem- for the
Church in 1318, when Angelo da Clareno defied the authority of Pope John XXII. 
Other figures included Michael of Cesena and Peter Olivi.

The Fraticelli ("Little Brethren") were extreme proponents of the rule of Saint 
Francis of Assisi, especially with regard to poverty, and regarded the wealth of
the Church as scandalous, and that of individual churchmen as invalidating their 
status. They were thus forced into open revolt against the whole authority of 
the Church.

The persecution of Fraticelli is the background for Umberto Eco's The Name of 
the Rose.<LINK>art:pages/art/The_Name_of_the_Rose</LINK>
