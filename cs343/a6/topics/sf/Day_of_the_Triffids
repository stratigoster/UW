The Day of the Triffids is a post-apocalyptic 1951 novel by the British science 
fiction author John Wyndham, later made into a film (1962) and a BBC TV-series 
(1981).

Warning: Plot details follow.

The "triffid" of the title is a very strange fictional plant, which has 
rudimentary animal-like behaviour: it is able to uproot itself and move, and 
possesses a whip-like poisonous sting.

The narrator recounts how the plant was discovered when he was a child, and 
quickly becomes established as a major crop due to its invaluable edible oils 
and proteins. After an aeroplane accident, seeds spread across the world and the
plants become commonplace. Many households keep them as a curiousity, almost a 
garden pet, making sure to have the sting docked at regular intervals. In 
commercial exploitation, the stings are left intact as docking impairs the 
quality of the plant.

The book opens with the narrator in hospital, with his eyes bandaged after 
having been stung by a triffid. He discovers that while he had been blindfolded,
anunusual meteor shower has blinded most people on Earth. He finds people in 
London struggling to stay alive, some cooperating, some fighting: after just a
few days society is collapsing.

Meanwhile, triffids are quickly regrowing their stings. Undocked triffids in 
captivity break free. The handful of sighted survivors escape the general 
collapse, to be faced by the growing numbers of free, undocked triffids, which 
attack animals to later digest the bodies with their roots.

The possible intelligence of the plants is suggested; as well as the idea that 
they may have been genetically engineered by humans in the first place. The 
question of whether the meteor shower was in fact some sort of space-based 
weapons system which misfired is also raised.

In the film, the triffids arrive as spores in the same meteor shower that 
blinded almost everyone on earth, which at least simplifies the number of 
assumptions required to make the plot work. The film supplies a simplistic 
solution to the triffid problem, while the novel and the BBC adaptation end with
the triffids still dominant and a few human survivors grimly attempting to fight 
back.

In 2001 a sequel to the novel was published. It was entitled "The Night of The 
Triffids" and written by Simon Clark.
