<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This is the first of three assignments devoted to constructing a
scanner, parser, and MIPS code generator for SL programs.  These
assignments are heavily tool-dependent.  You will be using the JLex
scanner generator and the CUP parser generator to build an SL compiler
written in Java. SL is described by the <A HREF="../sl/index.html">SL
language specification</A>.

<P> The actual work you need to do for this particular assignment is
relatively minor.  Most of the work will be in understanding the tools,
their documentation, how they fit together, and the purpose of the code
that we provide with this assignment.  Acquiring this understanding is
definitely a significant amount of work.

<P> The MIPS assembler is written in Java using many of the same
techniques required in order to complete this and the next two
assignments, and using the same tools.  The source code for the MIPS
assembler is therefore a resource that you can use as an example of a
working solution to a similar problem.

<H3>Some Hints about Directory Structure</H3>

<P>While working on each question, you will find it most convenient if
your scanner specification file is called simply "<TT>Yylex</TT>".  For
submission purposes, however, each question requires a file with a
different name.  Therefore, you should set up a separate directory for
each question, plus a separate submission directory.  Symlink the actual
working files in each question directory (all called "<TT>Yylex</TT>")
into the submission directory under the appropriate name.

<P> Please note that you are responsible for submitting correctly.  There
are ways for you to determine unambiguously whether or not your submission
worked as expected; see the <TT>submit</TT> man page for more details.

<H3>Building your Program</H3>

You will need to read the JLex documentation to learn many of the details
you will need in order to complete this assignment successfully.  To
reduce confusion, here is a synopsis of the process you need to follow in
order to turn your source files into Java class files.  You will need to
go through this process for questions 2 and 3.  Question 1 is simpler;
there is no CUP file, so step 2 can be omitted.

<OL>
<LI>Symlink the provided code (see below) into your working directory 
for the current question.
<LI>Use Java CUP to convert the parser specification (trivial file
<TT><A HREF="code/SL.cup">~cs241/pub/a/3/code/SL.cup</A></TT>, 
provided by us) into a pair of Java source files (<TT>parser.java</TT> 
and <TT>Sym.java</TT>).  The command line you need is as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
java java_cup.Main -symbols Sym &lt;SL.cup
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <LI>Use JLex to convert your scanner specification 
(file <TT>Yylex</TT>) into a Java source file (<TT>Yylex.java</TT>).  
The command line you need is as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
java JLex.Main Yylex
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <LI>Use the Java compiler to compile all the Java source files:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
javac *.java
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</OL>

<P>Only the last two steps above need to be repeated as you modify your
code.  Of course you will want to create a script (or makefile if you're
looking to learn another useful tool) to automate the above.  Remember
<B>Your Unix</B> and the tutor(s) are there to help.

<P> You will not use any package declarations in your code.  You may want
to modify your <TT>CLASSPATH</TT> to include "<TT>.</TT>", the current
directory.

<P>You may assume that all input files will end with a newline character.

<H3>Where to go for Information</H3>

As mentioned above, most of the work of completing this assignment is
reading documentation and learning how the provided tools work. Here are
some links that will be helpful:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="/~isg/res/java/jlex/manual.html">JLex 
Documentation</A> - Documentation for the JLex scanner generator.  
Most questions about how JLex works can be answered by reading this document.
You may need to read it more than once and compare it to the provided 
examples to understand JLex.
<LI><A HREF="/~isg/res/java/src/mips/">MIPS Source Code</A> - 
Source code for the MIPS tools.  The assembler is built using JLex and 
CUP, so the MIPS source code provides sample input files for both tools.  
There are many files here; you will want to concentrate on the JLex and 
CUP specification files <TT>Yylex</TT> and <TT>MIPS.cup</TT>.
    <LI><A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/j2se/1.3/docs/api">Java 
2 Platform API</A> - Javadoc documentation for the Java libraries from 
Sun.  You will need to use a few procedures from these libraries in 
your programs.

resources, including the above, related to Java.  This link is also 
available off the main CS 241 web page.

<H2>Question 0 - Sample JLex Specification (0% of your final grade)</H2>

You are given the file <TT><A
HREF="Yylex.0">~cs241/pub/a/3/Yylex.0</A></TT>, which is a simple JLex
specification somewhat similar to the one you will be creating for
Question 1.  Compile and run the program; the process is the same as that
required for Question 1.  Make sure you understand the process, and learn
from the JLex documentation what each part of <TT>Yylex.0</TT> means. Try
various valid and invalid inputs. Only then should you proceed to Question
1.  The same <a href="Main.java">Main.java</a> used in Question 1 should
be used for Question 0.

<H2>Question 1 - Small Integer Warm-Up (1% of your final grade)</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
In this and the next question (Questions 1 and 2), you will asked to provide a 
DFA (with actions) as input to JLex.  You will not be using the 
full power of JLex.  Each "regular expression" in the JLex specification 
file will just be a set of individual characters expressed using 
the '<TT>[</TT>' ... '<TT>]</TT>' feature of regular expressions.  In 
other words, <TT>yytext()</TT> will always be just one character and 
each piece of action code you write will be responsible for handling just 
the single "current" character. It is important to understand that 
failing to handle the input one character at a time will result in significant 
marking deductions.

<P>It will be helpful to draw your solution as a DFA on paper before trying 
to code it in JLex.  Note that in order to work as expected your solution 
must be a DFA, not an NFA.  If you code an NFA in your JLex specification 
file (to think about: how would you do that?), it will in fact be 
interpreted as a DFA in a manner which is indirectly specified in the 
JLex documentation.

<P>
<H3>Requirements</H3>

<p>Your main task is to define a DFA in JLex which accepts files with one
line consisting precisely of a positive integer without leading zeros that
is divisible by both 3 and 5. (Can you tell that one of your instructors
is also teaching MATH 135 this term?) Actions cannot be used to complete this main task.

<P>Additionally, for each accepted word (integer), your DFA must use
actions to compute and output (using <tt>System.out.println</tt>) the
longest string of consecutive digits in the input. If there is a "tie" then the first (or leftmost) such string should be printed. For each rejected word,
upon discovery of the error, you must execute
<tt>System.err.println("Rejected")</tt> and then terminate immediately
using <tt>System.exit(-1)</tt> (rather than consuming the rest of the
input as is done with some of the in-class examples).
 
<P>All computations and recognition must be done "on the fly". That is,
you must solve this problem using the DFA in a meaningful way. You cannot,
for example, accumulate all the input and then use Java on its own (as a
final action) to do the recognition.

<h3>Hints</h3> 

<ol> 

<li>For this question, use <TT><A
HREF="Main.java">~cs241/pub/a/3/Main.java</A></TT> as the main program.

<li>You may want to build your solution gradually, using JLex at each
stage to see how your scanner file gets transformed into a Java file.</li>

<li>You can use the <tt>.</tt> to match all "other" characters
in JLex.  That is, if you have: 
<pre>
&lt;X&gt; [1-3] {otherstuff}
&lt;X&gt; . {stuff}
</pre>
JLex will do <tt>stuff</tt> if any other character other than 
1, 2 or 3 is matched.  While this (kind of) creates an NFA (you should
figure out why), JLex will only do <tt>otherstuff</tt> on input
1, 2 and 3, and thus, this is truly a DFA.

<li>Newline is not matched by <tt>.</tt>.

<li>Recall that an integer is divisible by 5 iff it ends in 0 or 5.

<li>Recall that an integer is divisible by 3 iff the sum of its digits is
divisible by 3. Do not sum the digits as you go and check this condition
at the end of the input. This violates the requirements! Instead, try to
imagine a finite set of states "you can be in" allowing you to test this
condition "on the fly".

</ol>

<H3>Documentation</H3>

<P>For this (and subsequent questions), Java documentation is not required
but you must give your states meaningful names.

<H3>Testing</H3>

<P>Some test cases are available at <TT><A
HREF="test1/">~cs241/pub/a/3/test1</A></TT>. Passing these test cases is
necessary but not sufficient in order to obtain correctness marks on this
question. Many questions about precisely what constitutes correct program
behavior can also be answered by looking at these examples.

<H2>Question 2 - Subset of SL (1.5% of your final grade)</H2>

For this question you are still subject to the limitations on use of JLex from Question 1.
Question 3 will be essentially like this question, but you will be asked to use the full
power of JLex.
<P>
Write a scanner that recognizes tokens in SL.  Your finished program will read an
SL program from standard input, and print out the tokens contained within on standard output.
We have already written a main program and other support code.  When your scanner is combined with
the provided code, the result will be a tokenizer similar to the MIPS tokenizer contained in the
Java class <TT>mips.tok</TT>.
<P>
Provided code, available in <TT><A HREF="code/">~cs241/pub/a/3/code/</A></TT>:
<UL>
    <LI><TT><A HREF="code/SLToken.java">SLToken.java</A></TT> - A file which implements the SL
        tokens.  Your code will call into this file to create SL token objects which are then
    returned to the main program.
    <LI><TT><A HREF="code/tok.java">tok.java</A></TT> - A main program which implements a
        tokenizer, given the scanner you will be creating.
    <LI><TT><A HREF="code/SL.cup">SL.cup</A></TT> -  A skeletal version of the grammar
        specification file for SL.  In Assignment 4 you will be filling this in to contain a
    complete context-free grammar for SL.  For now it is needed only because the token
    types available in SL must be listed here in order for the compilation process to work.
</UL>
<P>
For this question you are restricted to recognizing one character at a time.  This makes it
very tedious to build a scanner specification for all of SL.  Therefore, for this question you should assume SL only contains the following features:
<UL>
    <LI>Comments
    <LI>Identifiers
    <LI>Keywords <TT>char</TT> and <tt>if</tt>
    <LI>Operators <TT>==</TT> and <TT>|</TT>
</UL>

<P>Note that this means, for example, that for this question, <TT>while</TT> 
is scanned as a valid identifier.

<P>
You should implement the required features in the order listed - first 
comments, then identifiers, then continue with the keywords and operators.  
Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding.
<P>
If an invalid character sequence is detected, your program should exit 
and print the error message "<TT>Illegal character at line <I>NN</I></TT>" 
to standard <B>output</B> (not standard error as might be expected), 
where <TT><I>NN</I></TT> is replaced by the appropriate line number.  The
error message must be preceded by a newline (to ensure that it starts at 
the beginning of a line) and be followed by a single newline.  Some of 
the provided test cases are an invalid <TT>.sl</TT> file so you can check 
that your program does <B>exactly</B> the right thing.  Lines are numbered
starting from 1. Only valid tokens preceding the illegal character should
be returned as they are scanned.

<P>Some test cases are available at 
<TT><A HREF="test23/">~cs241/pub/a/3/test23</A></TT>.
Passing these test cases is necessary but not sufficient in order to 
obtain correctness marks on this question.  Many questions about what 
constitutes correct program behaviour can be answered by looking at 
these test cases.
<P>
Note:  You are doing lexical analysis only!  Don't worry about
syntactic or semantics errors for this assignment.<p>

<H2>Question 3 - Scanner for SL (1% of your final grade)</H2>

Write a scanner that recognizes all tokens in SL.  Your program will 
do the exact same thing as
your program from Question 2, but since you are permitted to use the full power of JLex, it is not
difficult to handle all tokens.  You must not declare any scanner states for this question, or
mention any scanner states in your JLex specification; instead, you will be writing regular
expressions for each token type and the JLex tool will create all the states internally.
<P>
You may use the test cases from Question 2 to test your submission to this question.  However,
you will obviously require many more test cases since in Question 2 most tokens were considered invalid input
and the provided test cases were not sufficient even for Question 2.
<P>
Note:  You are doing lexical analysis only!  Don't worry about
syntactic or semantics errors for this assignment.<p>
