To check your program against one of these test cases, say case N:

	java Main <tN.in >&temp
	diff tN.out temp

If the diff is successful (that is, your program's output is identical
to the correct output), then your program passes that test case,
assuming that you used the correct output stream.  Standard output
is used for normal results, standard error for error messages.

Note that for the provided test cases, the first four should result in
output going to standard error whereas the last two should result in
output going to standard output.
