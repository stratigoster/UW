This file contains the Nullable results from running calcNullable.
The column indicates whether or not a given nonterminal is nullable.
The only changes you should make to this file are to change the
appropriate 'N's to 'Y's. For example, if you calculated that <S> was
nullable, you would change the 'N' beside <S> to 'Y'.

<S>     N
<T>     N
<U>     Y
<V>     Y
<W>     Y
<X>     N
